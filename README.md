# ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Price Prediction and Market Analysis

Welcome to the **Real-Time Stock Price Prediction and Market Analysis** repository! This project focuses on predicting stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques. We utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock prices for the next 10 days, based on historical data from 2010 to 2023. The application also visualizes market trends in a user-friendly manner using Streamlit.

   Start the Streamlit app by executing:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Select Stock**:
   Use the dropdown menu to select the stock you want to analyze.

3. **View Predictions**:
   The application will display predictions for the next 10 days along with visualizations of historical data.

## How It Works

### Data Collection

The application collects historical stock price data from 2010 to 2023 using Pandas-DataReader. This data includes open, high, low, and close prices.

### Data Preprocessing

The data undergoes several preprocessing steps:

- **Normalization**: Scale the data to improve model performance.
- **Splitting**: Divide the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Training

We use an LSTM model due to its effectiveness in time series forecasting. The model is trained on the historical data, learning patterns and trends.

### Predictions

After training, the model can predict stock prices for the next 10 days. The predictions are displayed in the application.

## Visualizations

The application features various visualizations, including:

- **Line Charts**: Display stock price trends over time.
- **Bar Charts**: Compare historical prices.
- **Prediction vs Actual**: Visualize predicted prices against actual prices.
